Hi all,
It's been sometime since I started my journey into the field of Data Analytics. Everyday is like a learning for me. Every mistake which I make is like a new lesson. 
Okay, let's get straight to the point. I have started a working on a dashboard for a Sales Transaction Datasets which higlights the purchases done by various customers around the world.
I have created a dashboard with very basic details of the datasets, like No. of Order placed or cancelled in various countries, Numbers of customers in a specific country and Country wise orders.
Let me emphasize on the columns in this datasets. They are:
Transaction No., Date, Product No., Product Name, Price, Quantity, CustomerNo, Country and Status. Status was the only column which I added for easier usage.
The first chart in the Dashboard namely 'PC_Orders_Distinct' shows the numbers of orders placed or cancelled in all the countries or specifically any country(The filter which I added on the side is for this chart)
The second chart in the Dashboard namely 'HighestCustomers_Distinct' shows the number of customer present in each country with UK being the highest.
The third chart in the Dashboard namely 'Highest_No_of_Orders_Distinct' again shows the number of orders placed in each country specifically. 
Kindly check out this link for looking into the dashboard.
